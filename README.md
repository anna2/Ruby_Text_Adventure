Grandma's House: The Text Adventure
=========

This is a command-line text adventure written in Ruby. I wrote it to practice Ruby basics and learn about topics like RSpec and web scraping.

Objective: Find Grandma before your sanity points bottom out.

Instructions: Discover the rules as you go. I recommend walking around the house and poking at stuff and maybe putting it in your satchel if it looks useful. Your curiosty will be rewarded.

##How to use it

Download the project and, from inside the main directory, run ```ruby start.rb``` from the command line.

##Some Cool Bits / Spoilers

1. When you read the newspapers in Grandma's House, you'll notice the headlines have been scraped from The Onion.

2. The dungeon boss is an angry housecat.

##To do:

1. Continue developing a web version with user authentication and the capacity to save in-progress games.
2. Error handling.
3. More tests.
4. Some sweet ASCII art.
